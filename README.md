# MedSentiment: AI-Powered Sentiment Analysis for Healthcare

MedSentiment is an open-source project aimed at developing an advanced sentiment analysis tool tailored specifically for the medical industry. Our mission is to empower
healthcare providers, particularly in Southern Africa, with actionable insights from patient reviews and feedback to enhance patient care and improve service delivery.

## Project Overview

### The project involves several key phases:
- Data Collection: Gather patient reviews and feedback from various sources.
- Data Anonymization: Ensure all collected data is anonymized and complies with data protection regulations to safeguard patient privacy.
- Evaluation of Existing Tools: Test current sentiment analysis tools to assess their effectiveness in the medical context.
- Tooling Determination: Decide on the most suitable technology stack—whether to use.
